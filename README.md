# DocumentSimilarity

The project is predominantly geared towards applying the concepts of natural language processing! 
In the current project, the goal is to take a series of wikipedia articles and calculate the similarity 
between each of these featured articles. The major metric used in the process to determine the similarity 
is the distance measurements.
